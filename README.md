# SOS-RESCUE-APPLICATION
As the name suggests SOS Rescue Application is software that can be used for the safety of people. It is fully based on the concept of helping the people who feel they might be in danger or if they feel someone else might be needing some help. Usually, if someone is in danger, it is quite difficult for to call anyone and it might take some time for the necessary authorities to reach that location quickly Therefore the SOS Rescue Application was designed. After the release of this system, the with the simple press of a button, the owner of the phone can call for help instantly. It might be either to the authorities or an emergency contact that has to be already pre-programmed in the application. Our project introduces SOS Rescue Application with an objective to make the calling for help easier and fast while also alerting anyone nearby. This mini-project explores how computer technology can be used to solve the problem of personal safety of a user.
